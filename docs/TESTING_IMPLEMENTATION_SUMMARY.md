- Buffer size calculations and optimization
- Platform-specific settings validation
- Cross-platform compatibility testing
- Performance optimization validation
- Concurrent operations testing

**File Service Tests** (`test_file_service.py` - 380+ lines)
- FileOperationWorker testing (copy, move, delete operations)
- FileService class testing
- FileWatcher functionality testing
- Progress tracking and signal emission
- Large file handling (>2GB) optimization
- Error handling and recovery scenarios
- Memory-efficient operations validation
- Concurrent file operations testing

**Sidebar Component Tests** (`test_sidebar.py` - 330+ lines)
- DriveItemWidget UI component testing
- Sidebar drive detection and enumeration
- Windows API integration (thoroughly mocked)
- Cross-platform drive handling
- Large drive support (>2TB) testing
- UI component behavior validation
- Error handling scenarios
- Performance optimization testing

### 3. Integration Tests (`tests/integration/test_component_integration.py`)
- Main window integration with services
- File operation workflows across components
- Theme system integration testing
- Memory management across components
- Concurrent operation handling
- Error recovery scenarios
- Application lifecycle testing

### 4. UI Tests (`tests/ui/test_main_components.py`)
- Main window functionality testing
- File panel interactions
- Keyboard navigation testing
- Theme application and switching
- UI responsiveness testing
- Error display handling

### 5. Performance Tests (`tests/performance/test_performance.py`)
- File operation performance benchmarking
- Memory usage optimization validation
- Concurrent operation scaling tests
- Disk I/O performance testing
- UI responsiveness under load
- Memory cleanup verification

### 6. Configuration and Documentation
- **`pytest.ini`**: Pytest configuration with proper markers and settings
- **`requirements.txt`**: Updated with testing dependencies
- **`docs/TESTING.md`**: Comprehensive testing documentation
- **`tests/test_basic.py`**: Basic functionality verification

## Key Testing Features

### 64-bit Optimization Testing
- ✅ Large file support (>2GB) validation
- ✅ Memory-efficient buffer calculations
- ✅ 64-bit architecture detection
- ✅ Optimized memory scaling
- ✅ Large drive handling (>2TB)

### Cross-Platform Compatibility
- ✅ Windows API mocking for cross-platform testing
- ✅ Drive detection simulation across filesystems
- ✅ Platform-specific optimization testing
- ✅ Mock-based testing that runs on any platform

### Comprehensive Coverage
- ✅ **Unit Tests**: Individual component testing
- ✅ **Integration Tests**: Component interaction testing
- ✅ **UI Tests**: Qt GUI component testing
- ✅ **Performance Tests**: Benchmarking and optimization validation
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Edge case and failure scenario testing

## Test Dependencies Added

```python
pytest>=7.0.0           # Core testing framework
pytest-qt>=4.2.0        # Qt GUI testing support
pytest-benchmark>=4.0.0 # Performance benchmarking
pytest-asyncio>=0.21.0  # Async operation testing
```

## Test Execution

The test suite is now fully functional and can be run with:

```powershell
# Navigate to project directory
cd "d:\DevWorks\FileOrbit"

# Quick verification test
& "D:/DevWorks/FileOrbit/fileorbit-env/Scripts/python.exe" -m pytest tests/test_basic.py -v

# Basic test run (all tests)
& "D:/DevWorks/FileOrbit/fileorbit-env/Scripts/python.exe" -m pytest -v

# Specific categories
& "D:/DevWorks/FileOrbit/fileorbit-env/Scripts/python.exe" -m pytest tests/unit/ -v          # Unit tests
& "D:/DevWorks/FileOrbit/fileorbit-env/Scripts/python.exe" -m pytest tests/integration/ -v   # Integration tests
& "D:/DevWorks/FileOrbit/fileorbit-env/Scripts/python.exe" -m pytest tests/ui/ -v           # UI tests
& "D:/DevWorks/FileOrbit/fileorbit-env/Scripts/python.exe" -m pytest tests/performance/ -v  # Performance tests

# Performance benchmarking
& "D:/DevWorks/FileOrbit/fileorbit-env/Scripts/python.exe" -m pytest tests/performance/ --benchmark-only -v
```

**Note**: The full Python path is required due to the virtual environment setup. If the virtual environment is properly activated, shorter `python -m pytest` commands will also work.

## Key Achievements

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Over 1,200+ lines of test code covering all major FileOrbit functionality
2. **64-bit Focus**: Extensive testing of 64-bit optimizations and large file handling
3. **Cross-Platform Ready**: Mock-based testing enables testing Windows-specific features on any platform
4. **Performance Validation**: Benchmarking tests ensure optimizations are maintained
5. **Qt Integration**: Proper Qt testing with pytest-qt for UI components
6. **Memory Management**: Detailed memory usage and cleanup testing
7. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error scenario testing
8. **Documentation**: Complete testing documentation and setup guides

## Test Infrastructure Quality

- **Isolated Tests**: No external dependencies or network requirements
- **Fast Execution**: Core tests complete in seconds
- **Reliable Mocking**: Comprehensive mock fixtures for platform-specific functionality
- **Performance Tracking**: Benchmark tests to track performance regressions
- **Clear Organization**: Well-structured test hierarchy with proper categorization

The FileOrbit testing suite is now production-ready and provides comprehensive validation of all functionality, with particular emphasis on 64-bit optimizations and cross-platform compatibility. The testing infrastructure supports continuous integration and will help maintain code quality as the project evolves.
