### Recent Development Sprint (December 2024)

#### Issues Addressed
1. **UI Navigation Problems**:
   - Sidebar navigation always affected left panel
   - Missing toolbar navigation icons
   - Inconsistent panel activation feedback

2. **Technical Challenges**:
   - Python bytecode cache preventing updates
   - Qt6 compatibility warnings
   - JSON serialization of Qt objects
   - Path object type mismatches

3. **Setup and Installation**:
   - Virtual environment setup reliability
   - Cross-platform script compatibility
   - Dependency management

#### Solutions Implemented
1. **Active Panel Tracking**:
   ```python
   # Added panel_activated signal to FilePanel
   panel_activated = Signal(str)
   
   # MousePressEvent detection
   def mousePressEvent(self, event):
       super().mousePressEvent(event)
       self.panel_activated.emit(self.panel_id)
   
   # MainWindow coordination
   def _on_panel_activated(self, panel_id):
       self.active_panel = panel_id
   ```

2. **Emoji-Based Toolbar Icons**:
   ```python
   # Cross-platform compatible icons
   self.back_button.setText("‚Üê Back")
   self.forward_button.setText("Forward ‚Üí") 
   self.up_button.setText("‚Üë Up")
   self.copy_button.setText("üìÑ Copy")
   self.move_button.setText("‚úÇÔ∏è Move")
   self.delete_button.setText("üóëÔ∏è Delete")
   ```

3. **Cache Management System**:
   ```batch
   # run_clean.bat script
   @echo off
   echo Cleaning Python cache...
   for /d /r . %%d in (__pycache__) do @if exist "%%d" rd /s /q "%%d"
   del /s /q *.pyc
   python -B main.py
   ```

4. **Qt6 Compatibility**:
   ```python
   # Removed deprecated high DPI attributes
   # Qt6 handles high DPI automatically
   # app.setAttribute(QtCore.Qt.AA_EnableHighDpiScaling, True)  # Removed
   # app.setAttribute(QtCore.Qt.AA_UseHighDpiPixmaps, True)     # Removed
   ```

#### Testing and Validation
- Manual testing of panel navigation behavior
- Cross-platform script testing
- Cache clearing validation
- Theme switching verification
- File operation testing

#### Documentation Updates
- Created comprehensive troubleshooting guide
